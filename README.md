# What is this?

This project was conceptualized as an idea to merge the physical and logical aspects of computer networking into a VR experience. I worked with two colleagues to learn, plan, and iterate on this design.

* Users can walk around and manipulate 3D objects in a small square environment.
* Three computers with prototype routers can simulate a physical LAN connection.
* Behind the user there is a prototype WiFi router that can be connected from the WAN (simulated from the wall). This will "turn on" mobile devices and tablets.
* The connection is simulated by an IF statement script that will replace the array values of material in a mesh filter with desired materials. EX: black screen (off) to white screen (on) or connection successful, etc...

# How I worked on this project

This project was conceptualized as an idea to merge the physical and logical aspects of computer networking into a VR experience. I worked with two colleagues to learn, plan, and iterate on this design.

* This project was ultimately built in Unity.
* All movement, camera, and VR manipulation were built using the incredible guides from Valem Tutorials. https://www.youtube.com/@ValemTutorials
* It uses Nico Garcia's basic WireBuilder C# code as a base. https://www.patreon.com/nicogarciasdev/home
  
# Why I built the project this way

* We discovered Unity is the leading platform for VR applications and games.
* Coming in with no C# knowledge, we knew the Unity software would be friendlier than alternatives.
* Virtual reality could be an efficient tool to teach conventional concepts in a remote environment.

# If I had more time I would change this

* Using the knowledge gained from modifying Nico Garcia's script for our needs--I would create a 'Wire Builder' from scratch that could fit the project more precisely.
* Assets would be created in a separate program or commissioned by artists.
* The project would be gamified. Instead of simply interacting with wires and equipment--the player could search through mazes of shelves, closets, and broken equipment to put together a system or network within an allotted time. If successful, they could pass to a new level with new build requirements.
* I would debug the project and learn how to avoid the current errors with library connections in C#.
